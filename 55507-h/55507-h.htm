<span class="i0">These are the utterance of my present heart,<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">It</span> seems to me like yesterday,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The morning when I took my way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the shore&mdash;in solitude;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in that miserable mood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was relief to quit the ken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the inquiring looks of men&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The looks of love and gentleness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pity, that would fain express<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a>{10}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its only purpose was to know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, knowing, it might soothe my woe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when I felt that I was free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From searching gaze, it was to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like ending of a dreary task,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or putting off a cumbrous mask.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">I wandered forth upon the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wishing this lie of life was o’er;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was beyond I could not guess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought it might be quietness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now I had no dream of bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No thought, no other hope but this&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be at rest&mdash;for all that fed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dream of my proud youth had fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My dream of youth, that I would be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happy and glorious, wise and free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mine own right, and keep my state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would repel the heavy weight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a>{11}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The load that crushed unto the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The servile multitude around;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The purpose of my life had failed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heavenly heights I would have scaled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed more than ever out of sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Further beyond my feeble flight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauty of the universe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was lying on me like a curse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only the lone surge at my feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uttered a soothing murmur sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As every broken weary wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sunk gently to a quiet grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dying on the bosom of the sea&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And death grew beautiful to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until it seemed a mother mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I like some too happy child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A happy child, that tired with play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through a long summer holiday,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Runs to his mother’s arms to weep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His little weariness asleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a>{12}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rest&mdash;rest&mdash;all passion that once stirred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart, had ended in one word&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My one desire to be at rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lay my head on any breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where there was hope that I might keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dreamless and unbroken sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lulled ocean seemed to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“With me is quiet,&mdash;come away.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is a tale that oft has stirred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My bosom deeply: you have heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How that the treacherous sea-maid’s art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With song inveigles the lost heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some lone fisher, that has stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For days beside the glimmering flood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when has grown upon him there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mystery of earth and air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cannot find with whom to part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The burden lying at his heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So when the mermaid bids him come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a>{13}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And summons to her peaceful home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hears&mdash;he leaps into the wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find a home, and not a grave.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Anon I said I would not die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I loathed to live&mdash;I feared to die&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I went forward, till I stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid a marble solitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A ruined town of ancient day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I rested where some steps away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From other work of human hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two solitary pillars stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two pillars on a wild hill side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like sea-marks of a shrunken tide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their shafts were by the sea-breeze worn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath them waved the verdant corn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a few paces from the crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that green summit, farther down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fallen pillar on the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow sinking in the earth again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a>{14}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bedding itself in dark black mould,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay moveless, where it first had rolled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It once had been a pillar high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pointing to the starry sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now lay prostrate, its own weight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now serving but to fix its state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sink it in its earthy bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gazed, and to myself I said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“This pillar lying on the plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hand of man might raise again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And set it as in former days;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the fall’n spirit who shall raise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What power on earth? what power in heaven?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How quickly was an answer given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto this voice of my despair!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now I sat in silence there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought upon the vanished time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my irrevocable prime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My baffled purpose, wasted years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sin, my misery&mdash;and my tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a>{15}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell thick and fast upon the sands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hid my face within my hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For tears are strange that find their way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the open eye of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the broad and glorious sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full in the heavens, as mine have done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as upon that day they did,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unnoticed, unrestrained, unchid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How long I might have felt them flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a check, I do not know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But presently, while yet I kept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That attitude of woe, and wept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mild voice sounded in mine ears&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“You cannot wash your heart with tears!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I quickly turned&mdash;and, vexed to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seen in my spirit’s agony,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In anger had almost replied&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An aged man was at my side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think that since my life began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never saw an older man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_016" id="page_016"></a>{16}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than he who stood beside me then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with mild accents said again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“You cannot cleanse your heart with tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though you should weep as many years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As our great Father, when he sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uncomforted on Ararat&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This would not help you, and the tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which does not heal, will scald and sear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is your sorrow?”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Until now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never had unveiled my woe&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not that I shunned sweet sympathies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man’s words, or woman’s pitying eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that I felt they were in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And could not help me&mdash;for the pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wound which I was doomed to feel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man gave not, and he could not heal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in this old man’s speech and tone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was something that allured me on:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_017" id="page_017"></a>{17}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I told him all&mdash;I did not hide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sin, my sorrow, or my pride:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I told him how, when I began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First to verge upward to a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These thoughts were mine&mdash;to dwell alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My spirit on its lordly throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hating the vain stir, fierce and loud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The din of the tumultuous crowd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how I thought to arm my soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stablish it in self-controul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said I would obey the right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would be strong in wisdom’s might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bow unto mine own heart’s law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And keep my heart from speck or flaw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in its mirror I might find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A reflex of the Eternal mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A glass to give me back the truth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how before me from my youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A phantom ever on the wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appearing now, now vanishing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a>{18}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">From painting, or from work divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of poet’s, or of sculptor’s art;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how I feared it might depart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That beauty which alone could shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light on my life&mdash;and then I said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would beneath its shadow dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would all lovely things compel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that was beautiful or fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In art or nature, earth or air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be as ministers to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep me pure, to keep me free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From worldly service, from the chain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of custom, and from earthly stain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how they kept me for a while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And did my foolish heart beguile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet all at last did faithless prove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, late or soon, betrayed my love;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My heart, which I had thought to steep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hues of beauty, and to keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its consecrated home and fane,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Which from without and from within<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had gathered there, till all was sin,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A shadow of displeasure past,<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
